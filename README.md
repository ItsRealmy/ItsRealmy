# Hello!
I'm Realmy, a full stack developer with an appreciation for Node.js, CustomDev lead developer and Beat Saber fan! I make Discord bots, websites, anything that comes to mind, really! You wont see much public repo's here, since I prefer closed source over open source. Thank you for checking out my profile!
